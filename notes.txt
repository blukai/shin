@BlindDerive
----
when you derive a trait (e.g., `Clone`) on a generic type, the derive just
assumes that all the generic parameters must be `Clone`. ofthen that is a valid
idea, but sometimes not.

@BorrowDoesNotContinue
----
the borrow checker does not understand that the borrow does not continue into
the next loop iteration.

TODO:
  - super minimal rotating triangle example without sx
  - figure out why i can't get anything happen with opengl 3.3 core profile
  - figure out why everything is black on nvidia gpu
  - can i hash all the shapes that can be pushed into draw buffer and NOT draw
    if prev frame hash == next frame hash?
  - i want to be able to attach custom shaders to probably sub-drawbuffers
  - i want rounded corners
